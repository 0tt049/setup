## Check-up

Let's check if you successfully installed everything.

Quit all opened Terminal, open a new one and run the following commands:

```bash
gist --login
# This will ask for you GitHub nickname and password. You can type them.

curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/master/check.rb | ruby
```

It should tell you if your workstation is ready :) If not, ask a teacher.
