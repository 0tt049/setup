## Check-up

Let's check if you successfully installed everything.

Quit all opened Terminal, open a new one and run the following commands:

```bash
curl -Ls https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lewagon/setup/master/check.rb | ruby
```

It should tell you if your workstation is ready :) If not, ask a teacher. If you don't want
your email to appear on your GitHub profile, you can now revert the `Public email` setting.
