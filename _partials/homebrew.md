## Homebrew

On Mac, you need to install [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/) which is a Package Manager.
It will be used as soon as we need to install some software.
To do so, open your Terminal and run:

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

This will ask for your confirmation (hit `Enter`) and your **macOS user account password** (the one you use to [log in](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202860) when you reboot your Macbook).
:warning: When typing a password in the Terminal, you will **not** get a visual feedback (something like `*****`), this is **normal**!! Type the password and confirm by typing `Enter`.

If you already have Homebrew, it will tell you so, that's fine, go on.

Then install some useful software:

```bash
brew update
```

If you get a `/usr/local must be writable` error, just run this:

```bash
sudo chown -R $USER:admin /usr/local
brew update
```

Error message or not, proceed running the following in the terminal (you can copy / paste all the lines at once).

```bash
brew upgrade git         || brew install git
brew upgrade gh          || brew install gh
brew upgrade wget        || brew install wget
brew upgrade imagemagick || brew install imagemagick
brew upgrade jq          || brew install jq
brew upgrade openssl     || brew install openssl
```

## Apple Silicon computers

<details>
  <summary>Forgot if your computer uses Apple Silicon ?</summary>

  &nbsp;


  Copy-paste the following command in the terminal and hit `Enter` to execute the command.

  ``` bash
  arch_name="$(uname -m)"

  if [ "${arch_name}" = "x86_64" ]; then
      if [ "$(sysctl -in sysctl.proc_translated)" = "1" ]; then
          echo "Your computer uses Apple Silicon (Rosetta) üåü"
      else
          echo "Your computer has an Intel processor ü§ñ"
      fi
  elif [ "${arch_name}" = "arm64" ]; then
      echo "Your computer uses Apple Silicon üåü"
  else
      echo "Unknown architecture: ${arch_name}, call a TA ü§î"
  fi
  ```

  ‚òùÔ∏è The result of the command should indicate whether your computer uses Apple Silicon.

</details>

If your computer uses **Apple Silicon**, run the following command. If not, ignore it.

``` bash
echo 'export RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--with-openssl-dir=$(brew --prefix openssl@1.1)"' >> ~/.zshrc
```
