## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your terminal

Instead of using the default `bash` [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)), we will use `zsh` and its plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

You should see something like this:
