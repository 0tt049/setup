## Git

To install `git`, first open a terminal. To open a terminal, hit **Start** and type **windows terminal** and click on **Windows Terminal (Preview)**.

Then copy **line by line** (this will help you identify which line fails if needed :thumbsup:):
You can paste by doing a right click in the terminal.

```bash
sudo apt update
```
```bash
sudo apt install -y git apt-transport-https unzip gnome-terminal
```
