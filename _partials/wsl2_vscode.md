## Visual Studio Code

Let's install the text editor in which you will write your code :nerd_face:.

We will be using Visual Code Studio because of it's extensive compatibility with your terminal.

Go the [Visual Studio Code page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and click on Windows. The tool should start to download automatically. Open the file you have just downloaded. Install it leaving all the default functionalities.

Let's add an extension to VS Code **Remote Development** to help VS Code interact with your terminal. Go to the [extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) and click on **Install**. This will tell you that VS Code is required to install this extension. Click on **Continue**. You will get an alert asking you to open Visual Studio Code. The editor will open to the extension page.

Your code editor is ready :muscle:.
