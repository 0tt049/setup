### Connecting VS Code to Ubuntu

- Launch VS Code a first time, then:
    - Pin it to the taskbar; you will be using it a lot!
    - You should have a frame at the bottom-right corner of VS Code saying it detects WSL
    - Accept the installation of the WSL extension for VS Code

:warning: This extension is mandatory for you to be able to work with VS Code!
