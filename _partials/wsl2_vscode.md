## Visual Studio Code

Let's install the text editor in which you will write your code :nerd_face:

We will be using Visual Code Studio because of it's extensive compatibility with your terminal

Go the [visual studio code page](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and click on Windows. The download of the tool should start automatically. Then open the executable and install it leaving all the default functionalities.

Let's add an extension to VS Code **Remote Development** to help VS Code interact with your terminal. Go to the [extension page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack) and click on **Install**. This will prompt you that VS Code is required to install this extension, click on **Continue**. You will get an alert asking you to open Visual Studio Code. The editor will open to the extension page

Your code editor is ready :muscle:
