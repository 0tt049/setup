## Remote tools

To be able to interact when you are not on site, we will be using two tools.

### Zoom

Zoom is a video conferencing, go to [zoom page](https://zoom.us/download) and under *Zoom Client for Meetings* hit the **Download** button. open the executable you have just downloaded, a progress bar will appear then zoom will start. Click on **Connexion** and create an account. Once connected, zoom should look like this:

You can close zoom now :wink:.

### Teamviewer



For the most extreme bugs, a teacher might have to take control over your machine. to be able to do that we will need the Teamviewer tool. Go to the [teamviewer download page](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download). It should automatically detect your exploitation system, if it doesn't don't hesitate to chose it from the list at the top of the page. Click on **Download Teamviewer**. Open the executable you just have downloaded, leave default settings and click on **Accept**. Progress bar will appear then Teamviewer will start when the installation is over. it should look like this:

You can close Teamviewer now :wink:.

:warning: We will not and cannot take control over your computer without your permission. Your teamviewer password changes every time you restart the application :thumbsup: We will only use this tool in last resort if a teacher needs hands on your machine. :warning:
