## Remote tools

To be able to interact when you are not on site, we will be using two tools.

### Zoom

Zoom is a video conferencing tool, go to [Zoom page](https://zoom.us/download) and under **Zoom Client for Meetings** hit the **Download** button. Open the file you have just downloaded. A progress bar will appear, then Zoom will start. Click on **Connexion** and create an account with the **Sign Up Free** option:

Once connected, you should see:

You can close Zoom now :wink:

### Teamviewer

For the most complicated problems, a teacher might have to take control of your computer. To be able to do this, we will need to use the Teamviewer tool. Go to the [Teamviewer download page](https://www.teamviewer.com/en/download). It should automatically detect your operating system. if it doesn't, choose your operating system from the list at the top of the page. Click on **Download Teamviewer**. Open the file you just have downloaded. Leave the default settings and click on **Accept**. A progress bar will appear, then Teamviewer will start when the installation is over. It should look like this:

This will only be used as last resort when debugging becomes too tricky orally. Nobody will ever be able to take control of your screen without you knowing it :ok_hand:

You can close Teamviewer now :wink:
