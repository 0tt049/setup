## Installing Ruby (with [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv), not rvm)

You may already have installed ruby, but we are going to do it again using `rbenv`, a manager for installing different Ruby versions on your computer. If you installed `rvm` before, run `rvm implode` to remove it beforehand.

Open a Terminal, and run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install -y build-essential tklib zlib1g-dev libssl-dev libffi-dev libxml2 libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev libreadline-dev
sudo apt-get clean
sudo mkdir -p /usr/local/opt && sudo chown `whoami`:`whoami` $_
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv.git /usr/local/opt/rbenv
git clone https://github.com/rbenv/ruby-build.git /usr/local/opt/rbenv/plugins/ruby-build
source ~/.zshrc
```
