## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your terminal

We will use the shell named `zsh` instead of `bash`, the default one.

In a terminal execute the following command and type in your password if asked:

```bash
sudo apt install -y zsh curl vim imagemagick jq
```

Then copy-paste the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

```

When asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:
