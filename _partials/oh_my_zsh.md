## Oh-my-zsh - Fancy your terminal

Instead of using the default `bash` [shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)), we will use `zsh` and its plugin [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/).

In a terminal execute the following command and type in your password if asked:

```bash
sudo apt install -y zsh curl vim imagemagick jq
```

Then copy-paste the following command:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

When asked "Do you want to change your default shell to zsh?", press `Y`

At the end your terminal should look like this:
