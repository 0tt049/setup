### Settings

Launch the app and sign in to `lewagon-alumni` organization.

The idea is that you'll have Slack open all day, so that you can share useful links / ask for help / decide where to go to lunch / etc.

To ensure that everything is working fine for video calls, let's test your camera and microphone:
- Open the Slack app
- In any channel message bar type `/call --test` and press Enter
- Click on the "Start test" green button

When the test is finished, you should see green "Succeed" messages at least for your microphone and camera. If not, ask a teacher.

You can also install Slack app on your phone and `lewagon-alumni`!
