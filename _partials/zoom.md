## Zoom

To be able to interact when we are not in the same physical room, we will be using Zoom.

⚠️ If you already have Zoom installed, please make sure that the version is at least **5.4**. Otherwise, you will not be able to use breakout rooms in order to work with your buddy.

Zoom is a video conferencing tool. To create an account and install the app, go to [https://zoom.us/download](https://zoom.us/download) and under **Zoom Client for Meetings** click the **Download** button. Open the file you have just downloaded. A progress bar will appear, then Zoom will start. Click on **Connection** and create an account with the **Sign Up Free** option:

You can close Zoom now.
