## yarn

[`yarn`](https://yarnpkg.com/) is a package manager to install JavaScript libraries. Let's install it:

In a terminal, run the following command:

```bash
npm install --global yarn
```

Restart your terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn -v
```

You should see a version. If not, ask a teacher.
