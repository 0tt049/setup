## Install Brew

To get Homebrew working, letâ€™s install it using Rosetta:
```bash
arch -x86_64 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
```

Solution is :

- Open Sublime text app then go to File > Open
- Browse to /Users/your_name et press cmd + shift + "." to display hidden files and open .zshrc
- Past the line ZSH_DISABLE_COMPFIX=true before the line source $ZSH/oh-my-zsh.sh
- Save the file and restart your terminal: cmd + "Q"
- Original solution found [here](https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/issues/6835#issuecomment-390216875)
