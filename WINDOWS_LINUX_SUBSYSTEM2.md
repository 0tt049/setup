# Setup your machine!

Welcome to this setup where we are going to install the tools required to make your machine a true developer environment :muscle:



## Prerequisites

Before we start it is important you meet the following prerequisites to ensure the smooth running of the setup.
Take your time to read through everything and do not hesitate to ask for help if you feel stuck.
Ready? Let's go :sunglasses:



## Latest version of Windows

For this setup, you need to be running on the latest version of Windows.

This means that you need to be on Windows 10 with all the latest updates installed.

You can check your software version by clicking on **Start>Settings>System>About**, look where it says *edition*. If you see something that starts with "Windows 10..." you're good to go :muscle:.

Not the case? Don't panic :scream: You can always install windows 10 from [microsoft]( https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows/get-windows-10) and click on *Check for Updates* then follow the instructions on screen. Come back to this setup when Windows 10 is installed.

Once you are sure that you're running Windows 10, you will need to check that your machine is running with all the latest updates. For this click on **Start>Settings>Updates & Security>Windows Update** then click on **Check updates**. If you have updates available please install them and repeat until it says that you are up to date :star:.



## The insider program

As a soon-to-be-developer, you always want to get the beta version of everything :nerd_face:.

This also applies to Windows, so we are going to sign up to their beta program, the **Insider program** .

Go to **Start>Settings>Updates & Security>Insider Program**

Click on **Get Started**. It will ask you to **Link an account**; follow the instructions on screen. You will be prompted (code-speak for being asked) to choose your insider parameters, choose the second setting, the **fast** one :zap:. Then confirm and restart your computer when you are prompted to do so.

After your computer has restarted you can double-check that you are now part of the insider program by clicking on **Start>Settings>Updates & Security>Insider Program**, you should then be prompted with the insider parameter that you chose earlier (**fast**).

By joining the insider program you have unlocked more content and updates - which we also want to install. Go to **Start>Settings>Updates & Security>Windows Update**, you should see new updates available.
:warning: These updates can be very long (more than 30 minutes) so make sure your computer has battery and that you won't have to close it during the installation :warning:

Start the updates and go grab a coffee :coffee: or tea :tea:.

After your computer has restarted, go to **Start>Settings>System>About**, this time check the *Version*, if it says at least 2004, you are good to go :sunglasses:.
